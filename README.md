Independently designed and implemented a console-based pet care scheduling application. This application allows users to register pets, log care appointments, and generate reports on overdue or upcoming visits.

Specifically, performed the following tasks. 

    1. Defined the 'Pet' and 'Appointment' classes to capture registration and scheduling data using encapsulation. 

    2.Built logic to record and store pet data and associate each 'Appointment' object with the corresponding 'Pet' instance. 

    3.Used 'LocalDateTime' from 'java.time' to validate that appointments occur in the future. 

    4.Created reporting logic to identify pets with upcoming appointments in the next 7 days and those overdue for vet visits by 6 months or more. 

    5.Applied 'HashMap<String, Pet>' and 'ArrayList<Appointment>' to store and navigate records efficiently. 

    6.Used file I/O and serialization ('ObjectOutputStream', 'ObjectInputStream') to save and reload application data, demonstrating data persistence, across sessions. 

By completing both projects, I learned i can design and implement Java applications using 'class' structures, encapsulation, 'HashMap', 'ArrayList', exception handling, 'Scanner' input, and file-based persistence. You can build robust, user-driven systems that store and manage data, respond to user choices, and produce meaningful reports.
